    "# Pleasant Lake Example\n",
    "This example is a simplified version of the Pleasant Lake model published by Fienen et al (2021). The goal of the Pleasant Lake model, part of the Central Sands Lake Study, was to address connections between groundwater abstraction and ecological function of a lake in central Wisconsin, USA (WDNR 2021; Figure 1). This required modeling at multiple scales. Fine discretization was needed near the lake for accurate simulation of water levels and groundwater-lake flux. A large model domain was also needed, to simulate farfield water-use activity (chiefly irrigated agriculture) in order to delineate a limit of connection, as well as to incorporate distant hydrologic boundaries. Adopting a fine enough discretization for the lake detail throughout the farfield would have resulted in a model with more cells than could be practically managed. To mitigate this, three models were combined: a large regional model built with MODFLOW-NWT (Niswonger et al. 2011), an intermediate MODFLOW 6 model inset within the regional model to simulate the irrigated agriculture area, and a refined MODFLOW 6 inset model (nested within the intermediate model) to simulate the lake. Regional groundwater flow and the effects of distant boundaries were simulated with the MODFLOW-NWT model, which was coupled sequentially (one-way) to the MODFLOW 6 models through time-varying specified head boundaries along the intermediate MODFLOW 6 model perimeter. The two MODFLOW 6 models were coupled dynamically (both ways) within the groundwater flow solution, allowing for feedback between the models. Estimates of groundwater recharge for the MODFLOW models were provided by a soil water balance code (SWB; Westenbroek et al 2018) simulation that could consider alternative assumptions of climate and land use. Net infiltration estimates from the SWB model were conveyed to the Recharge Packages in the MODFLOW models using the NetCDF functionality in Modflow-setup. \n",
