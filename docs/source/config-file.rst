The configuration file
=======================


The YAML format
---------------
The configuration file is the primary model of user input to the ``MF6model`` and ``MFnwtModel`` classes. Input is specified in the `yaml format`_, which can be thought of as a serialized python dictionary with some additional features, including the ability to include comments. Instead of curly brackets (as in `JSON`_), white space indentation is used to denote different levels of the dictionary. Value can generally be entered more or less as they are in python, except that dictionary keys (strings) don't need to be quoted. Numbers are parsed as integers or floating point types depending whether they contain a decimal point. Values in square brackets are cast into python lists; curly brackets can also be used to denote dictionaries instead of white space. Comments are indicated with the `#` symbol, and can be placed on the same line as data, as in python.

Modflow-setup uses the `pyyaml`_ package to parse the configuration file into the ``cfg`` dictionary attached to a model instance. The methods attached to ``MF6model``, ``MFnwtModel`` and ``MFsetupMixin`` then use the information in the ``cfg`` dictonary to set up various aspects of the model.


Configuration file structure
----------------------------
In general, the configuration file structure is patterned after the MODFLOW input structure, especially the `input structure to MODFLOW-6`_. Larger blocks represent input to MODFLOW packages or modflow-setup features, with sub-blocks representing MODFLOW-6 input blocks (within individual packages) or individual features in modflow-setup. Naming of blocks and the variables within is intended to follow MODFLOW and Flopy naming as closely as possible; where these conflict, the MODFLOW naming conventions are used (see also the `MODFLOW-NWT Online Guide`_).


Package blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The modflow-setup configuration file is divided into blocks, which represent sub-dictionaries within the ``cfg`` dictionary represented by the whole configuration file. The blocks are generally organized as input to individual object classes in Flopy, or features specific to MODFLOW-setup. For example, this block would represent input to the `Simulation class`_ for MODFLOW-6:

.. code-block:: yaml

	simulation:
  	  sim_name: 'mfsim'
  	  version: 'mf6'
  	  sim_ws: '../tmp/shellmound'

and would be loaded into the configuration dictionary as:

.. code-block:: python

	cfg['simulation'] = {'sim_name: 'mfsim',
	                     'version': 'mf6',
	                     'sim_ws': '../tmp/shellmound'
	                     }

The above dictionary would then be fed to the Flopy `Simulation class`_ constructor as `keyword arguments (**kwargs)`_.

Sub-blocks
^^^^^^^^^^
Sub-blocks (nested dictionaries) with blocks are used to denote either input to MODFLOW-6 package blocks or input to modflow-setup features. For example, the options block below represents input to the options block for the MODFLOW-6 name file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    model:
      simulation: 'shellmound'
      modelname: 'shellmound'
      options:
        print_input: True
        save_flows: True
        newton: True
        newton_under_relaxation: False
      packages: ['dis',
                 'ic',
                 'npf',
                 'oc',
                 'sto',
                 'rch',
                 'sfr',
                 'obs',
                 'wel',
                 'ims'
                 ]
      external_path: 'external/'
      relative_external_filepaths: True

Note that some items in the model block above do not represent flopy
input. The ``relative_external_filepaths`` item is a flag for modflow-setup that instructs it to reference external files relative to the model workspace, to avoid broken paths when the model is copied to a different location.

Directly specifying MODFLOW input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MODFLOW input can be specified directly in the configuration file using the appropriate variables described in the `MODFLOW-6 input instructions`_ and `MODFLOW-NWT Online Guide`_. For example, in the block below, the dimensions and griddata sub-blocks would be fed directly to the `ModflowGwfdis`_ constructor in Flopy:

.. code-block:: yaml

    dis:
      remake_top: True
      options:
        length_units: 'meters'
      dimensions:
        nlay: 2
        nrow: 30
        ncol: 35
      griddata:
        delr: 1000.
        delc: 1000.
        top: 2.
        botm: [1, 0]


Source_data sub-blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Alternatively, ``source_data`` subblocks indicate input from general file formats (shapefiles, csvs, rasters, etc.) that needs to be mapped to the model space and time discretization. The ``source_data`` blocks are intended to be general across input types. For example- ``filename`` indicates a file path (string), regardless of the type of file, and ``filenames`` indicates a list or dictionary of files that map to model layers or stress periods. Items with the '_units' suffix indicate the units of the source data, allowing modflow-setup to convert the values to model units accordingly. In the example below, the model top would be read from the specified `GeoTiff`_ and mapped onto the model grid via linear interpolation (the default method for model layer elevations) using the `scipy.interpolate.griddata`_ method. The model botm elevations would be read similarly, with missing layers sub-divided evenly between the specified layers. For example, the layer 7 bottom elevations would be set halfway between the layer 6 and 8 bottoms. Finally, supplying a shapefile as input to idomain instructs modflow-setup to intersect the shapefile with the model grid (using :meth:`rasterio.features.rasterize`), and limit the active cells to the intersected area.

.. code-block:: yaml

    dis:
      remake_top: True
      options:
        length_units: 'meters'
      dimensions:
        nlay: 13
        nrow: 30
        ncol: 35
      griddata:
        delr: 1000.
        delc: 1000.
      source_data:
        top:
          filename: 'shellmound/rasters/meras_100m_dem.tif' # DEM file; path relative to setup script
          elevation_units: 'feet'
        botm:
          filenames:
            0: 'shellmound/rasters/vkbg_surf.tif' # Vicksburg-Jackson Group (top)
            1: 'shellmound/rasters/ucaq_surf.tif' # Upper Claiborne aquifer (top)
            2: 'shellmound/rasters/mccu_surf.tif' # Middle Claiborne confining unit (top)
            3: 'shellmound/rasters/mcaq_surf.tif' # Middle Claiborne aquifer (top)
            6: 'shellmound/rasters/lccu_surf.tif' # Lower Claiborne confining unit (top)
            8: 'shellmound/rasters/lcaq_surf.tif' # Lower Claiborne aquifer (top)
            9: 'shellmound/rasters/mwaq_surf.tif' # Middle Wilcox aquifer (top)
            10: 'shellmound/rasters/lwaq_surf.tif' # Lower Wilcox aquifer (top)
            12: 'shellmound/rasters/mdwy_surf.tif' # Midway confining unit (top)
          elevation_units: 'feet'
        idomain:
          filename: 'shellmound/shps/active_area.shp'


Some additional notes on YAML
---------------------------------------
* quotes are optional for strings without special meanings. See `this reference`_ for more details.
* (``None`` and ``'none'``) (``'None'`` and ``'none'``) are parsed as strings (``'None'`` and ``'none'``)
* null is parsed to a ``NoneType`` instance (``None``)
* numbers in exponential format need a decimal place and a sign for the exponent to be parsed as floats.
  For example, as of pyyaml 5.3.1:

    * ``1e5`` parses to ``'1e5'``
    * ``1.e5`` parses to ``'1.e5'``
    * ``1.e+5`` parses to ``1.e5`` (a float)
* sequences must be explicitly enclosed in brackets to be parsed as lists.
  For example:

    * ``12,1.2`` parses to ``'12,1.2'``
    * ``[12,1.2]`` parses to ``[12,1.2]``
    * ``(12,1.2)`` parses to ``"(12,1.2)"``
    * ``{12,1.2}`` parses to ``{12: None, 1.2: None}``
