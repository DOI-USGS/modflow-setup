modflow-setup |version|
=======================


Modflow-setup is a Python package for automating the setup of MODFLOW groundwater models from grid-independent source data including shapefiles, rasters, and other MODFLOW models that are geo-located. Input data and model construction options are summarized in a single configuration file. Source data are read from their native formats and mapped to a regular finite difference grid specified in the configuration file. An external array-based `Flopy <https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy>`_ model instance with the desired packages is created from the sampled source data and configuration settings. MODFLOW input can then be written from the flopy model instance.
