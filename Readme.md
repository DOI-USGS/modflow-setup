modflow-setup
-----------------------------------------------
Package to facilitate automated setup of MODFLOW models, from source data including shapefiles, rasters, and other MODFLOW models that are geo-located. Input data and model construction options are summarized in a single configuration file. Source data are read from their native formats and mapped to a regular finite difference grid specified in the configuration file. An external array-based [flopy](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy) model instance with the desired packages is created from the sampled source data and default settings. MODFLOW input can then be written from the flopy model instance.

Getting Started
-----------------------------------------------

Using a [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)-aware text editor, create a configuration file similar to the included test files:

* [MODFLOW-NWT example](https://github.com/aleaf/modflow-setup/blob/master/mfsetup/tests/data/mfnwt_inset_test.yml)
* [MODFLOW-6 example](https://github.com/aleaf/modflow-setup/blob/master/mfsetup/tests/data/shellmound.yml)

The yaml file summarize source data and parameter settings for setting up the various MODFLOW packages. To set up the model:

```
from mfsetup import MFnwtModel, MF6model

m = MF6model.setup_from_yaml(<path to configuration file>)
```
where `m` is a [flopy](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy) MODFLOW-6 model instance that is returned. The MODFLOW input files can be written from the model instance:

```
m.simulation.write_simulation()
```

MODFLOW-NWT version:

```
m = MFnwtModel.setup_from_yaml(<path to configuration file>)
m.write_input()
```
