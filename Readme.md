Modflow-setup
-----------------------------------------------
Modflow-setup is a Python package for automating the setup of MODFLOW groundwater models from grid-independent source data including shapefiles, rasters, and other MODFLOW models that are geo-located. Input data and model construction options are summarized in a single configuration file. Source data are read from their native formats and mapped to a regular finite difference grid specified in the configuration file. An external array-based [Flopy](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy) model instance with the desired packages is created from the sampled source data and configuration settings. MODFLOW input can then be written from the flopy model instance.

Getting Started
-----------------------------------------------
For more details, see the [modflow-setup documentation](https://aleaf.github.io/modflow-setup/)

Using a [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)-aware text editor, create a [configuration file](https://aleaf.github.io/modflow-setup/latest/config-file.html) similar to one of the examples in the [Configuration File Gallery](https://aleaf.github.io/modflow-setup/latest/config-file-gallery.html).

The yaml file summarizes source data and parameter settings for setting up the various MODFLOW packages. To set up the model:

```
from mfsetup import MFnwtModel, MF6model

m = MF6model.setup_from_yaml(<path to configuration file>)
```
where `m` is a [flopy](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy) MODFLOW-6 model instance that is returned. The MODFLOW input files can be written from the model instance:

```
m.simulation.write_simulation()
```

MODFLOW-NWT version:

```
m = MFnwtModel.setup_from_yaml(<path to configuration file>)
m.write_input()
```
